🚀 Robot Pathfinder Using AI Search Algorithms (BFS, DFS, A*)

This project is an interactive robot navigation system built using Python.
The user controls a robot placed inside a 5×5 maze, while AI algorithms provide intelligent hints to guide movement.
It demonstrates classical AI search algorithms like BFS, DFS, and A* in an easy, visual, emoji-based interface.
🧠 Features
🎮 Interactive Movement

Move the robot manually using W / A / S / D

Real-time grid updates

Collision detection (walls)

🤖 AI Hint System

B → BFS Hint

F → DFS Hint

H → A* Hint (Heuristic-based)

Each algorithm suggests the next optimal move based on its logic.

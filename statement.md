Project Title:

Robot Pathfinder Using AI Search Algorithms
Problem Statement

I wanted to build a small project that shows how a robot can find its way through a maze. The idea is to make a simple grid where a robot moves around, and AI algorithms help it by giving hints on which direction to go. This helps understand how search algorithms like BFS, DFS, and A* work in an easy and visual way.
Scope of the Project

The project is limited to a 5×5 grid with walls, empty cells, a robot, and a goal.
It is fully interactive — the user moves the robot manually, but can also take help from AI hints.
The project focuses on:

How algorithms search through paths

How hints can guide a user

Simple grid navigation

Basic Python implementation

It does not include advanced graphics, large maps, or auto-solving.
Target Users

Students learning basic AI algorithms

Beginners trying to understand BFS, DFS, and A*

Anyone interested in simple grid navigation simulations

Teachers who want a small demo to show pathfinding basics

High-Level Features

Emoji-based maze display (fun and easy to understand)

Manual robot control using W A S D

AI hint system using:

B → BFS

F → DFS

H → A*

Collision detection (walls)

Clean and simple Python code

Works directly in the terminal
